                    <p><i>Recently, the future has been a big topic of discussion among myself, friends, and family. What someone chooses as their future dictates what will come of their life, and that choice begins when you pick a major at the young age of 18 entering college. I myself have changed major when it became apparent that I wanted a different lifestyle than the one I originally planned to pursue. As a kid growing up I assumed I would be a mom with multiple kids living in the suburbs taking my kids to soccer practice and working a 9-5; however, as I grew older I realized that wasn’t necessarily my dream but rather society’s dream. Although we have drifted away from gender stereotyping, it is still expected that women will get married and raise a family one day. If someone decides not to have kids it often comes as a shock to their friends and family, but why is that? There are so many other things that life has to offer other than the ordinary suburban mom life. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to raise a family in a suburban area, as the years have gone on and I have realized what else life has to offer I have discovered that suburbia is a life path I do not want to follow. Being an advertising and public relations major I want nothing more than to live in a big city-preferably Chicago or Seattle. The constant excitement and busy atmosphere that accompanies the city is one that I crave. With any and all free time I plan to travel everywhere I possibly can in the world. Our world is drifting away quickly so I have made it a goal of mine to spend my life seeing as much of it as possible and embrace the beauty that surrounds us. I challenge you to consider what you want out of life. Is what you want your dream or someone else’s? Make sure it is your dream and chase after it harder than anything you’ve done before because your life is worth it.</i></p>

                    <h3>How to Apply Social Media to your Personal and Professional Life. November 6, 2018</h3><br>
                    <p><i>“The future is digital” This is something we hear nearly everyday no matter what you choose to major in. Despite the beliefs that our elders may hold, the fact that our society is and will continue to be digital is not changing no matter how big of an issue some people claim it is. With an Ad/PR degree comes lots of exposure to the outside world via all forms of social media outlets. However, how you put yourself out there and use your social media is something to be conscious of. Your online presence both as a professional and in your personal life are extremely important and being able to maintain a vibrant yet appropriate online platform is crucial. There are a few tips and tricks I have learned along the way as to how to enhance my professional online presence and how to continue to contribute to personal social media outlets in a respectable manner. <strong>Understand the platforms that are most beneficial for you/your company.</strong> There are endless platforms that one is able to use in order to promote a business or to put yourself out there and attract potential employers. Some of which include Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and multiple others. Some companies are better suited for certain social media platforms than others, but that is something that can be determined by your employees or through trial and error. Another asset to finding what works best is Google Analytics. This is a Google based program that one can get certified in and that allows the user to track countless things, one of which being how many people view/like/interact with your posts on social media and that will allow you as a company to be able to see which platforms are best getting to your clients. <strong> Make social profiles detailed yet reserved. </strong> Although social media is a way for you to express yourself, there is a fine line between what is/is not appropriate as well as being able to moderate what should or should not be posted. Keeping your personal and professional life separate is important, however, it is crucial to keep in mind that when posting on your personal account to still be appropriate. Employers look at potential employee’s social media accounts to see how they portray themselves and think about whether or not they would be a good fit for their company and if they could represent their company the way they expect their employees to do so. <strong> NETWORKING. </strong> In life, ESPECIALLY in the business world, WHAT you know is not nearly as important compared to WHO you know. It is all about connections in the business world and knowing the appropriate way to market yourself and your company. Internships and clubs within school are great ways to get to know people in the business industry and potentially secure a future job. Aside from personally making connections, making a LinkedIn account is a great way to promote yourself and your profile with works you have created over the years.<strong> Be yourself. </strong> Even though it is important to maintain a professional and appropriate social profile, remembering to not lose sight of who you are is equally as important as your authenticity could be what lands you your dream job one day. Being aware of the things to look out for on social media are very important as a prospective employee. Whether your job be in advertising, public relations, marketing, or an abundance of other possibilities being conscious of these tips and tricks will pay off in the long run. I plan on using all of these tips as I continue my schooling to get my Advertising and Public Relations degree and beyond my college years once I am employed as well.<i><p>
