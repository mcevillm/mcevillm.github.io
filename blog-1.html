                    <p class="mb-30">Recently, the future has been a big topic of discussion among myself, friends, and family. What someone chooses as their future dictates what will come of their life, and that choice begins when you pick a major at the young age of 18 entering college. I myself have changed major when it became apparent that I wanted a different lifestyle than the one I originally planned to pursue.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">As a kid growing up I assumed I would be a mom with multiple kids living in the suburbs taking my kids to soccer practice and working a 9-5; however, as I grew older I realized that wasn’t necessarily my dream but rather society’s dream. Although we have drifted away from gender stereotyping, it is still expected that women will get married and raise a family one day. If someone decides not to have kids it often comes as a shock to their friends and family, but why is that? There are so many other things that life has to offer other than the ordinary suburban mom life.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">While there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to raise a family in a suburban area, as the years have gone on and I have realized what else life has to offer I have discovered that suburbia is a life path I do not want to follow.</p>
		<p class="mb-30">Being an advertising and public relations major I want nothing more than to live in a  big city-preferably Chicago or Seattle. The constant excitement and busy atmosphere that accompanies the city is one that I crave. With any and all free time I plan to travel everywhere I possibly can in the world. Our world is drifting away quickly so I have made it a goal of mine to spend my life seeing as much of it as possible and embrace the beauty that surrounds us.</p>
		<p class="mb-30">I challenge you to consider what you want out of life. Is what you want your dream or someone else’s? Make sure it is your dream and chase after it harder than anything you’ve done before because your life is worth it.</p>
